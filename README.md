Nerve turns structured harness data into deterministic review evidence:

```text
existing data or Nerve source
  → versioned HIR
  → stable HK-* findings
  → review report, diffs, drawings, test plans, and manufacturing artifacts
```

The TypeScript API is one input format, not an adoption requirement. Nerve can import WireViz, mapped CSV and Excel wire lists, and connector contracts from KiCad boards, pinout CSV, tscircuit, or its own JSON format.

Nerve does not certify a harness or claim compliance with an industry or customer standard. Its reports record the deterministic checks performed on the facts supplied.

## What it does

- Runs 34 built-in consistency, electrical, component, and manufacturing checks with stable `HK-*` diagnostic codes.
- Produces a versioned machine-readable review report with HIR fingerprint, built-in rule coverage, findings, and explicit limitations.
- Accounts for every mapped CSV or Excel row as accepted or rejected, then emits editable Nerve source and HIR.
- Compares harness connector assignments with a KiCad 6+ board footprint's pad nets or another interface contract.
- Emits reproducible HIR, drawings, BOM, cut list, labels, continuity tests, assembly instructions, PDF packet, and release records.
- Evaluates rules against a provenance-aware public corpus without presenting synthetic regressions as field evidence.

The browser workspace remains available at [nerve.grayhavenindustries.com](https://nerve.grayhavenindustries.com) for inspecting examples and the authoring API.

## Review a harness

```bash
npm install @grayhaven/nerve @grayhaven/nerve-connectors @grayhaven/nerve-cli

npx --package=@grayhaven/nerve-cli nerve review ./src/main.harness.ts
# dist/review-report.json

npx --package=@grayhaven/nerve-cli nerve eval ./eval-corpus/manifest.json
# dist/eval/eval-report.json
```

`review-report.json` includes the harness revision, HIR schema, content fingerprint, tool and rule versions, findings, and limitations. The command exits nonzero when the report contains errors.

## Import an existing wire list

Create an explicit column map:

```json
{
  "wireId": "Wire",
  "fromConnector": "From",
  "fromPin": "From Pin",
  "toConnector": "To",
  "toPin": "To Pin",
  "signal": "Signal",
  "gauge": "Gauge",
  "color": "Color",
  "length": "Length",
  "lengthUnit": "Unit"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npx --package=@grayhaven/nerve-cli nerve import ./wire-list.xlsx \
  --sheet "Wire List" \
  --map ./columns.json \
  --id my-harness \
  --out ./migration
```

The output is a complete editable project: `src/main.harness.ts`, `nerve.config.ts`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, the reusable normalized `column-map.json`, `harness.json`, `diagnostics.json`, and `import-report.json`. The CLI immediately compiles the emitted source before reporting success. Unknown connector parts are marked `unverified`; missing signals stay missing; and every accepted or rejected source row remains visible in the report with row/column diagnostics.

## Compare a board connector

```bash
npx --package=@grayhaven/nerve-cli nerve contract ./src/main.harness.ts \
  --connector J1 \
  --against ./controller.kicad_pcb \
  --component J7 \
  --out ./dist/contracts
```

The adapter reads footprint reference properties, pad-to-net assignments, and explicit no-connect pads from a KiCad 6+ board file. It writes `contract-J1.normalized.json` with the board revision, ECAD component, generator/version, and a content fingerprint so the normalized input can be reviewed or committed. It does not infer graphical connectivity from a schematic.

## Authoring quick start

```bash
npx --package=@grayhaven/nerve-cli nerve init .
npx --package=@grayhaven/nerve-cli nerve compile ./src/main.harness.ts
npx --package=@grayhaven/nerve-cli nerve export ./src/main.harness.ts
```

```ts
import { connector, harness, wire } from "@grayhaven/nerve"
import { MolexMicroFit } from "@grayhaven/nerve-connectors"

const j1 = connector("J1", MolexMicroFit["43025-0800"], {
  pins: { 1: "VBAT_24V", 2: "GND", 3: "CAN_H", 4: "CAN_L" }
})

// See examples/motor-controller for a complete design.
```

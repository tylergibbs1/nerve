# The design surface.

Everything imports from `@grayhaven/nerve`. The DSL builds a typed design graph; `compileDesign` lowers it to the versioned HIR that every exporter and rule consumes.

Recent additions: parts accept `reservedPins` (cavities that must stay empty, enforced by HK-CONN-015) and `cavityLayout` (drives the connector face views); branches accept `minBendRadius` (breakouts tighter than it fail HK-MFG-005); sleeves named with a trailing capacity (`braided-pet-12`) are checked against the estimated bundle diameter (HK-MFG-006); connector parts with `currentLimitA`/`voltageLimitV` gate wire current and signal voltage (HK-CONN-016/017).

## harness(id, options)

The root design object. `revision` and `units` are required; releases fail closed without them.

## connector(id, part, { pins })

Place a connector from a part definition. `pins` maps pin numbers to signal names; parts declare `pinCount`, `gender`, and `wireGaugeRange`, and the rules hold wires to them. Per-pin `terminals` and `seals` feed the compatibility rules.

## wire(id, from, to, options)

Point-to-point conductor. Endpoints are `connector.pin(n)` references or splice ids. Gauge strings like `"20AWG"` are checked against ampacity (`currentEstimate`) and the connector range; any spelling (`"20 AWG"`, `"awg 20"`, `"20"`) canonicalizes to `"20AWG"` in HIR.

## splice(id, options)

A junction node (`type: "crimp"`, `"solder"`, …). Wires may terminate on a splice; nets are computed across it and splice-verification tests are generated. `branch` + `location` place it physically.

## cable(id, options)

Groups wires into a multi-conductor cable (wires opt in via their `cable`/`conductor` props), optionally shielded. Shield drains must land on a pin or the rules flag it.

## branch(id, { path, … })

Physical bundle segment: `path` lists the connectors it runs between, `nominalLength` drives the board view and cut-length math, `sleeve`/`breakoutDistance`/`minBendRadius` feed the manufacturing rules.

## label(id, { text, attachTo })

Printed label on the loom, attached to a branch or connector with an optional `offsetFrom`/`distance`; exported to the label schedule CSV.

## variant(base, overrides)

Derive a configuration from a base harness: add/remove wires per option code without forking the file.

## rule(name, run, { code })

Author a custom validation rule; `report()` diagnostics with a stable code. Plug in via `defineConfig({ rules })`.

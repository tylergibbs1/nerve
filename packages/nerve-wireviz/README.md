# @grayhaven/nerve-wireviz

WireViz YAML import/export adapter for Grayhaven Nerve, with diagnostics where concepts don't map cleanly.

The importer preserves WireViz's compact authoring features where they have an unambiguous Nerve representation:

- YAML anchors and merge keys, including an external prepend/template file
- named connector and cable instances such as `PLUG.J1` and `LOOM.CBL1`
- ascending and descending ranges such as `1-4` and `4-1`
- connector pin labels plus cable wire-label and unique color references
- numeric metre lengths and explicit `mm`, `cm`, `m`, `in`, or `ft` lengths

Template definitions used only to create named instances are not emitted as physical parts. Unsupported or lossy constructs produce `HK-WV-001` diagnostics; unnamed template instances currently require an explicit designator.

```bash
nerve import ./harness.yml --prepend-file ./templates.yml --out ./migration
```

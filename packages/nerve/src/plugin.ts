/**
 * Plugin SDK (PRD §40).
 *
 * Typed extension boundary. The contract:
 *  - plugins declare which HIR schema versions they support — the compiler
 *    refuses mismatches with a diagnostic instead of undefined behavior,
 *  - plugin rules report through the standard typed diagnostic channel,
 *  - plugins MUST NOT mutate the HIR (rules receive it read-only),
 *  - plugins are plain modules, executable locally and in CI.
 *
 * First plugin surface: rule packs (the §38 standards-pack vehicle).
 * Importers/exporters/renderers join as their host seams stabilize.

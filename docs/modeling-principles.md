# Harness modeling principles

Nerve models a physical electrical assembly and the evidence needed to build,
inspect, test, and release it. A harness is not merely a schematic graph and
not merely a drawing.

## The five layers

1. **Electrical intent** — signals, voltage/current expectations, differential
   pairs, shields, returns, and electrically common nets.
2. **Physical realization** — connector cavities, wire segments, cable
   conductors, splices, branches, protection, and accessible test points.
3. **Component selection** — housing, terminal, seal, splice, backshell, wire,
   and tooling master data, kept distinct from the instances that use it.
4. **Manufacturing definition** — lengths, tolerances, labels, routing,
   process instructions, and shop-specific capability limits.
5. **Verification evidence** — diagnostics, continuity/isolation tests,
   measurements, revisions, approvals, and as-built traceability.

Each layer may refer to the layers above it, but it must not silently invent
their facts. For example, a signal name cannot prove a shield termination
strategy, and a connector housing's family gauge range cannot prove that a
particular selected terminal accepts that wire.

## Core identities

- A **net** is an electrical equivalence class.
- A **wire** is a physical conductor segment between two endpoints.
- A **cable** is a physical jacketed product containing uniquely identified
  conductors; cable membership and conductor identity are different facts.
- A **splice** is an electrical junction and a manufacturing operation.
- A **connector pin** is a logical reference to a physical cavity. Signal,
  terminal, and seal population are separate attributes of that cavity.
- A **branch** is physical routing, not electrical connectivity.
- A **test point** is an accessible physical endpoint, not every graph node.

These distinctions prevent category errors such as treating two wires with
the same signal name as one physical conductor, assigning two wires to the
same cable conductor, or claiming continuity coverage for an inaccessible
splice-only net.

## Unknown, absent, and invalid

The model preserves three states:

- **Unknown**: a fact has not been supplied yet; completeness rules may warn.
- **Absent by design**: the fact does not apply, such as a solder-cup connector
  with no removable terminal MPN.
- **Invalid**: supplied facts contradict physical identity or dimensional
  constraints; compilation fails.

Defaults may fill organization policy, but must never turn unknown engineering
facts into apparently verified facts.

## Where validation belongs

Validation ownership follows the earliest layer that can know the truth:

- The **compiler** owns unconditional structural invariants: reference
  integrity, unique identities, valid quantities, and physically coherent
  cable-conductor assignments.
- **Generic rules** own conclusions that follow from declared facts, such as a
  missing terminal on a wired crimp-contact cavity or a net with too few
  accessible points for continuity testing.
- **Shop profiles** own capability limits such as approved tooling, sleeve
  capacity, tolerances, and local process requirements.
- **Standards profiles** own versioned policy such as identification schemes,
  derating tables, environmental rules, and acceptance-test programs.

A generic rule must not claim standards compliance, and a policy rule must not
guess facts that the HIR cannot represent.

## Verification principle

Generated tests prove the physical net through accessible connector pins. For
an electrical net with `N` accessible pins, the closed-circuit tests must form
a connected graph over all `N` points; merely emitting one test with the net's
name is not coverage. Nets with fewer than two accessible points are invalid
for point-to-point continuity testing and block release.
